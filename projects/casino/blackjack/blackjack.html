                <h1>Blackjack Rules</h1>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world.
                    <br>The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over.
                </p>

                <h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>

                <p>
                    - Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer also receives two cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11,
                                        depending on the player's choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand) to get as close to 21 as
                    <br>
                    possible without going over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game. The dealer wins automatically if the player busts.
                </p>

                <h3>Winning and Payout</h3>

                <p>
                    - If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting, they win the game and are paid 1:1 on their bet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - If a player is dealt a "Blackjack," which is an Ace and a 10-value card, they win 3:2 on their bet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a "push," and the player's bet is returned.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>
                    Blackjack is a game of skill and strategy. By making the right decisions, players can improve their chances of winning and enjoy an
